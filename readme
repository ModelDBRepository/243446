This model is from the following paper:

Yunliang Zang, Stéphane Dieudonné& Erik De Schutter. Voltage- and Branch-specific Climbing Fiber Responses in Purkinje Cells. Cell Reports in press.

type the following commands on the terminal to implement the demo code, which generates both simple spikes and complex spikes (at 400 ms)

nrnivmodl mod
nrngui purkinje_demo.hoc

To get the dissociated PC model, add the following 
"dendA1_00 disconnect()
dendA1_01 disconnect()"
into purkinje_demo.hoc, which only preserves the dendritic trunk. 

To achieve voltage-regulated dendritic and somatic responses, change the values of stim1.amp in Purkinje_demo.hoc

The Na entry ratio is defined as the ratio of total Na+ influx (1 ms before and after spike peak) to the Na+ influx (1 ms before spike peak).

If you need to simulate some properties the present model can't do,please contact zangyl1983@gmail.com. I may know the answer.


Changelog
---------

cdp_*.mod files are updated due to issue mentioned in https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/pull/1955.
CONSTANT block has no effect in the initialization of ion variables.
